  üì• 
  The user must first download the GitHub package and have a code editor that has Node.js installed.  
  The user must then run 'npm install' for all dependencies to be downloaded and installed in the repo.  
  This will then allow full functionality of the application.
  ```

  ## Usage 

  ```
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
  Run 'node index.js' from the CLI and follow the prompts. 
  There are a series of questions need to be answered in order to populate the required fields.  
  There are no restrictions if no response is provided.  The app has been left in this state so that you can create a README skeleton to come back to later or if some info you don't have on hand.  
  Once all the questions have been answered the README.md will be created.  The README is fully editable after this point.  
  There are links in the README that will work based on information inputted such as the GitHub link and the license more info link. Contents links are also fully functional.
